# Prospective website for Pulliam Petroleum

This is a website for one of my friends' business. It was my first attempt at 
designing a website (beyond "homework" assignments). Much of the content was 
repurposed from their previous website (which had been untouched for over 8 
years) with a few newer pictures. The service area map was my own creation and
I converted a rather large and unwieldy "tank chart" into a small "calculator."

Ultimately, they decided to go with a wordpress design as one of the family 
members felt capable of editing it when it needed updating.
