        <p id="aboutUsP1">
          Back in 1988 we started Pulliam Petroleum as a mom and pop operaton, literally. We ran the business from our small home in Sandy. Tony made deliveries from our lone truck and Sue did the bookkeeping and answered the phones all while taking care of three young children.

        <p id="aboutUsP2">
          Now it's over 25 years later and truth be told, not a whole lot has changed. We have a few more trucks and a few more drivers but Tony is still out making deliveries every day. Sue is still answering the phones. There are still young children around, only now they're grandchildren. We love and we appreciate all our customers for allowing us to grow our operation yet stay a family business. Which is good, because hard work runs in the family.
